Machine Learning Projects — Assignment

This repository contains three machine learning tasks demonstrating modern AI techniques including NLP with transformers, multimodal learning, and end-to-end model deployment.

Task 1 — News Topic Classifier Using BERT

Built a news classification model using BERT to categorize headlines into topics.

Dataset

AG News

Key Steps

Tokenized text using BERT tokenizer

Fine-tuned pretrained transformer

Evaluated using Accuracy and F1-score

Deployed interactive demo using Gradio/Streamlit

Outcome

A high-accuracy NLP classifier capable of predicting news categories such as World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.

Task 2 — Multimodal Housing Price Prediction
(Images + Tabular Data)

Developed a multimodal model to predict house prices using both structured data and property images.

Key Steps

Extracted image features using CNN (ResNet)

Processed tabular features (beds, baths, area)

Combined both modalities into a single model

Evaluated using MAE and RMSE

Outcome

Demonstrates how combining visual and numerical data improves prediction performance in real-world scenarios.

Task 3 — Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

Created an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict telecom customer churn.

Dataset
